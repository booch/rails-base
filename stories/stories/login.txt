Story: Login

As a user
I want to log in
So that I can use all the features of the site.


Scenario: Valid username/password
Given I am logged out
  And the 'test' user exists
  And has a password of 'test'
  And has been activated
When I visit '/session/login'
  And enter 'test' in the Login field
  And enter 'test' in the Password field
  And click on the 'Log in' button
Then I should be authenticated
  And I should end up at the home page
  And the flash should say 'logged in'

Scenario: Invalid username
Given I am logged out
  And the 'invalid username' user does not exist
When I visit '/session/login'
  And enter 'invalid username' in the Login field
  And enter 'test' in the Password field
  And click on the 'Log in' button
Then I should NOT be authenticated
  And I should end up at the login page
  And the flash should say 'incorrect username or password'
