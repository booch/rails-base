Version 1.3.2 - November 20, 2007
  * Brought back test cases (now auto-evals the erb template to test to make sure the template for the generator is valid)
  * Automatically added :for and :for_all_except aliases, for more natural expressions
  
Version 1.3.1 - November 14, 2007
  * Extends "access_denied" to render a 401 error if they are logged in but not authorized
  
Version 1.3 - November 13, 2007
  * Rails 2.0 ready - Both generators tested against Rails 1.99.0
  * Generators now generate RoleRequirementSystem and RoleRequirementTestHelper.  Automatically places RoleRequirementTestHelper include in test_helper.rb

  * Refactoring/Cleanup in attempt to make the code easier to understand.

Version 1.2.1 - August 22, 2007
  * Bugfix - script/generate roles was not generating role.rb, though the template was there.

Version 1.2 - August 15, 2007
  * Bugfix - the way RoleRequirement was auto-including dependencies was causing issues in some instances with ActiveSupport
  * New code generator for role-enum column approach (one role per user)
  * Code generators automatically insert your include dependencies into ApplicationController
  * role requirements are now inheritable (putting require_role in a parent controller will cause all children to require the role)

    * generates fixtures
    * generates models
    * modifies user.rb and adds the needed code for you.
