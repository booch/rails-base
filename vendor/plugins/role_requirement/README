== Summary ==
Version 1.1 - July 26, 2007

There are many role-based security plug-ins out there.  Often times, they are very complicated and much more than you need.

RoleRequirement focuses on a simple approach to role-based authentication.  you don't have to learn a new language in order to specify roles.  Instead, RoleRequirement leverages the power of Ruby to strike a marvelous balance between simplicity and flexibility.

Basic Features:

  * Implement role security system using an enum field or a habtm collection (user can have one or many roles)
  * Full Test Helpers to make it easy to test your controllers
  * Squeaky Clean implementation so you don't have to repeat yourself.


== Usage ==

Steps to using as easy as 1, 2, 3!

=== 1.  Install acts_as_authenticated and role_requirement ===

See install instructions below.  You must generate your User model from acts_as_authenticated and include AuthenticatedSystem in your ApplicationController, as usual.

=== 2.  Add has_role? to your User model ===

{{{
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
...
  # has_role? simply needs to return true or false whether a user has a role or not.  
  # It may be a good idea to have "admin" roles return true always
  # You can use either a habtm relationship for roles, or a simple enum field.
  # This example uses a habtm
  def has_role?(role)
    @roles ||= self.roles.collect(&:name)
    return true if @roles.include?("admin")
    (@roles.include?(role.to_s) )
  end
...
}}}

=== 3.  Require a roles in your controllers ===

It's easy as pie!

{{{

class Admin::Users < ApplicationController
  require_role "admin"
end

}}}

Unlimited flexibility without the mess!

{{{

class Admin::Listings < ApplicationController
  require_role "contractor"
  require_role "admin", :only => :destroy # don't allow contractors to destroy

  # leverage ruby to prevent contractors from updating listings they don't have access to.
  require_role "admin", :only => :update, :unless => "current_user.authorized_for_listing?(params[:id]) "

end

}}}
